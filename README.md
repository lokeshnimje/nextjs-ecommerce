## Description:
This is a dummy e-commerce application built using Next.js and React. The app allows users to browse a list of products, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. It leverages the power of Next.js server components for efficient data fetching and React client components for dynamic UI interactions. This project demonstrates the use of both server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) to create a seamless and optimized user experience.

## Features:

- Product listing with detailed information
- Add to cart functionality
- Checkout process
- Server-side data fetching for product information
- Responsive design with optimized performance
